Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files.

Miniprojects:

Python
- ML with Logistic Regression. To predict whether a customer will buy a product (1) or not (0) based on features such as age, income, and gender.
- ML with K Nearest Neighbours: To classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Exploratory Data Analysis of the Iris Dataset: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to identify and visualize the relationships and distinguishing characteristics of three species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning: Identifying Potential Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
- Identifying the worth of houses in Pune city: To identify which machine learning model is able to accurately estimate the worth of the house given the features.
