Miniprojects:

Python
- ML with Logistic Regression. To predict whether a customer will buy a product (1) or not (0) based on features such as age, income, and gender.
- ML with K Nearest Neighbours: To classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Exploratory Data Analysis of the Iris Dataset: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to identify and visualize the relationships and distinguishing characteristics of three species of iris flowers based on their measurements.

R
- Logistic Regression: To predict the salary class of people in the dataset.
